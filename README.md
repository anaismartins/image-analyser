# Virtual environment

To use this program, it is recommended to do so inside a virtual environment. You can do this with conda.

1. To create a virtual environment with conda use:

```
conda create --name <my-env>
```

By default, this should create a virtual environment with Python 3.9.13, which is enough for the use of this program.

2. To activate the virtual environment, use:

```
conda activate <my-env>
```

3. To run the program use:

```
python main.py
```
